# Chibaku Tensei
Bundle an whole project in a single file


## What is Chibaku Tensei?
Well it seems like you aren't a Naruto fan as I am. `Chibaku Tensei` is a technique used in the Naruto story, the following quote describes the mechanics behind this technique:
> "... releases a black sphere from his hands which acts as a centre of gravity, drawing in everything in its surroundings to create an enormous satellite-like construct."

## Motivation
Browserify does a pretty neat job at bundling code into a single file, plus using `require` in browser environment. But the code browserify produces most of the times isn't usable in node, so basically I want to do something that bundles everything into a single a file and execute it in node. This can be very useful to create executables out of your node apps.
